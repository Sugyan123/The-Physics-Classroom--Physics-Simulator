		<p style="color:black; font-size:20px;text-align: justify;">“The Physics Classroom” is a “Kinematics & Motion simulator”, Kinematics is a subfield of physics, developed in classical mechanics, 
			that describes the motion of points, bodies, and systems of bodies without considering the
			 forces that cause them to move. Dynamics the branch of mechanics concerned with the motion 
			 of bodies under the action of forces. Motion is mathematically described in terms of displacement,
			  distance, velocity, acceleration & speed.</p>

	<p style="color:black ;font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;"> Working: <br>This website has features like the User can set various kinds of scalar and vector
		 quantities as per his own requirement and visualise & simulate the body. Example: In case of simulation of 
		 Linear Acceleration the user can set his own required values of Vertical Speed, Horizontal Speed, vertical 
		 acceleration, Horizontal acceleration and can easily visualise and understand the phenomenon in a realistic manner.
		  The same is applicable for Circular motion, Net force, Friction Ramp and Newton’s First & Second Laws of Motion,
		   where user can assign values to quantities like Force, direction, mass, Ramp angle, Coefficient of Kinetic Friction, 
		   Velocity etc.</p>
